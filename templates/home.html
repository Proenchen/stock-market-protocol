        <p>Welcome to the <b>Global Stock Market</b> project page!</p>
        <p>
            Researchers have identified over 500 different characteristics that influence the stock market
            performance of companies. These anomalies often generate significant returns when used to
            construct a portfolio strategy. However, the replicability and future performance of these
            strategies still remain as open questions. While the initial results appear promising, there are
            ongoing concerns about whether these strategies can continue to perform well over time,
            especially in different market conditions. Many authors have proposed frameworks to address
            these issues, aiming to make the results more robust and reliable. These frameworks typically
            focus on improving the testing and validation processes to ensure that the strategies remain
            effective. However, most studies and proposed frameworks have primarily focused on the U.S. market,
            neglecting the significant role of other global markets. These markets may have distinct dynamics and
            behaviors that can influence the effectiveness of portfolio strategies.

            This project introduces user-friendly tools to analyze and interpret newly
            proposed factors that predict cross-sectional equity returns for global markets.
            It allows users to test proposed new return predictors by simply uploading a .csv file.
            After applying the protocol, the system emails the user a self-contained report that
            describes the results.
